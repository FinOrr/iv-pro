## Overview

Welcome to the FPGA Image and Video Processing (iv-pro) System repository! 
This project is an FPGA implementation written in VHDL, designed to perform image and video processing tasks. 

It supports two operational modes: standalone and coprocessor, offering flexibility and versatility in various applications.

## Features

- **Operational Modes:** Choose between standalone and coprocessor modes to suit your specific requirements.
- **Input Interfaces:** Supports flexible input interfaces, including serial and camera inputs, ensuring compatibility with different sources.
- **Real-time Filtering:** Enjoy real-time image and video filtering capabilities for on-the-fly processing.
- **Adaptable Output:** The system provides adaptable output options, including serial and VGA interfaces.

## Usage

### Standalone Mode

In standalone mode, the FPGA Image and Video Processing System can be used as a standalone processing unit. The input sources can be connected directly to the FPGA board.

### Coprocessor Mode

In coprocessor mode, the FPGA system can be integrated into a larger system as a coprocessor, collaborating with other components for enhanced processing capabilities.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FinOrr/iv-pro.git
   ```

2. Follow the hardware setup instructions in the documentation to connect the FPGA board.

3. Configure the FPGA with the provided VHDL code.

4. Explore and modify the code to customise the system according to your needs.
